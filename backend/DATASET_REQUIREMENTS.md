├── Front face (0°)         - 30% of images
├── Left 45°                - 15% of images
├── Right 45°               - 15% of images
├── Left profile (90°)      - 10% of images
├── Right profile (90°)     - 10% of images
├── Looking up              - 10% of images
└── Looking down            - 10% of images

Why: Real cameras won't always see perfect front faces
```

### 2. 💡 LIGHTING CONDITIONS
```

```

### 6. 🌍 BACKGROUNDS & SCENARIOS
```
Real-World Scenarios:
├── Indoor office           - 30% of images
├── Outdoor daylight        - 25% of images
